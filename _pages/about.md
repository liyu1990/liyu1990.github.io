I am currently a postdoc at School of Data Science of City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). 
Before coming to CityU, I received my Ph.D from Jilin University, where I was supervised by Prof. [Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). 
Before that, I was a data mining researcher at Qihoo360 from 2016-2018. In addition, I received my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree from Jilin University.

My research interests are in machine learning, graph representation learning and so on.
