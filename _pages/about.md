I am currently a postdoc at School of Data Science of City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/). 
Before coming to CityU, I received my Ph.D from Jilin University, where I was supervised by Prof. [Yi Chang](http://www.yichang-cs.com/). During that, I was a visiting student at Mila from 2021-2022, supervised by Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). 
I also worked at Qihoo360 as a data mining researcher from 2016-2018. In addition, I received my Master's degree and Bachelor's degree from Jilin University.

My research interests are in data mining, graph representation learning and so on.
